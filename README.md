# BaseSystem

[![Build Status](http://game-patcher.de:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=BaseSystem)](http://game-patcher.de:8080/job/BaseSystem/)

Base System can be seen as a blueprint to build a Java based Linux system that can host apps, render to a screen and communicate over network.
Base System is meant to be run on a raspberry pi with an optional touchscreen. It also can be run on Windows or other operating systems for debugging purposes.

This is a set of libraries. To view something on the screen, you will need to include the BaseSystem.jar in your Project and create your own System.
